# FLUX

FLUX uses a split checkpoint (i.e. UNET/VAE/CLIP aren't contained in a single file), therefore it can only be used in the "Advanced" checkpoint mode.

## Manual installation

Due to licensing restrictions, Metastable is unable to provide a fully automatic installation procedure for FLUX. The models can still be installed manually.
